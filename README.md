This code generates a random 4-digit number with no repeated digits as the secret code and asks the user to guess the code. The user has a limited number of tries and receives feedback on their guesses in terms of bulls (correct digit in the correct position) and cows (correct digit in the wrong position). The game continues until the user correctly guesses the secret code or runs out of tries. After each game, the user is given the option to play again.
